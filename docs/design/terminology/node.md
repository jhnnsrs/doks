## What is a node?

Nodes are a core conceptual element of the arkitekt platform, that represent the
functionality that Arkitekt can do for you. 

## Nodes are not 

One of the core concepts of Nodes are that they are not bound to an implementation. What do we mean with that:
Nodes are conceptual ideas about a specific task (like projecting an image)


## Programming Analogy

Everybody knows and loves functions, lets look at the sheer glory of one written in python:

```python

def project_image(image: Image, dim = "z") -> Image:
    pro


Nodes are best explained in interplay with explaining it with a Template
