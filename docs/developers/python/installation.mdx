# Installation

The easiest way to install the library is to use poetry or pip:

```python
pip install arkitekt
```

You can also choose to install arkitekt with its deveÄºopr api which comes with
its own CLI, and allows you to experience a set of additional features:

- A cli to create and manage projects
- Autogenerated code from the arkitekt api (GraphQL codegen)
- Dev mode to automatically reload the code when it changes
- A bundler to export your project as a standalone docker container

This is the recommend way to install arkitekt, especially if you are not planning
to use arkitekt as a dependency in another project.

```python
pip install "arkitekt[cli]"
```
