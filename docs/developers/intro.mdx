# Intro

You want to develop some functionaly for the arkitekt framework. Great!
Without you this framework would not exists. So thank you for your contribution.

So lets get you started!

## What is Arkitekt?

Let's answer this question a little bit more in detail. Arkitekt is a framework,
that aims to provide you the bioimage analyst developer with a set of tools to let you build
your own bioimage analysis pipeline, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure,
and without having to reinvent the wheel.

As such we are trying to provide you with a set of tools that will help you to build your own
applications, that you want to use for your own bioimage analysis. We also would like you to then
have an easy time sharing your analysis programs with others, so that they can use them as well.

## What is Arkitekt not?

Arkitekt is not a framework that will do the analysis for you. It is not a framework that will
provide you with a set of analysis tools. It is not a framework that will provide you with a
set of analysis algorithms. It is a backbone for exactly this. But you will (and have to ) be the star
of the show!
