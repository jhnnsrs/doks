### Type

#### [`Representation`](/docs/schemas/mikro/objects/representation) <Badge class="secondary" text="object"/>
> A Representation is 5-dimensional representation of an image

    Mikro stores each image as a 5-dimensional representation. The dimensions are:
    - t: time
    - c: channel
    - z: z-stack
    - x: x-dimension
    - y: y-dimension

    This ensures a unified api for all images, regardless of their original dimensions. Another main
    determining factor for a representation is its variety:
    A representation can be a raw image representating voxels (VOXEL)
    or a segmentation mask representing instances of a class. (MASK)
    It can also representate a human perception of the image (RGB) or a human perception of the mask (RGBMASK)

    # Meta

    Meta information is stored in the omero field which gives access to the omero-meta data. Refer to the omero documentation for more information.


    #Origins and Derivations

    Images can be filtered, which means that a new representation is created from the other (original) representations. This new representation is then linked to the original representations. This way, we can always trace back to the original representation.
    Both are encapsulaed in the origins and derived fields.

    Representations belong to *one* sample. Every transaction to our image data is still part of the original acuqistion, so also filtered images are refering back to the sample
    Each iamge has also a name, which is used to identify the image. The name is unique within a sample.
    File and Rois that are used to create images are saved in the file origins and roi origins repectively.
